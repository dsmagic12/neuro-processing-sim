An orange curtain hangs on the wall, and wooden cabinet doors are visible in the background. A Ludwig drum is partially seen on the right side. The room has a wooden floor and appears to be a home studio or personal music room.\n\nRetinal Photoreceptor Processing:\n\nCone Activation:\n- L-cones (red-sensitive): Strongly activated by the warm orange curtain and wooden tones\n- M-cones (green-sensitive): Moderately activated by the wooden floor and gray carpet\n- S-cones (blue-sensitive): Highly activated by the blue guitar, responding to shorter wavelengths\n\nRods:\n- Moderate activation due to relatively warm, diffuse lighting\n- Providing overall luminance detection and spatial context\n\nPhoton-to-Neural Transduction:\nThe photoreceptors would convert light photons into electrical signals through phototransduction, with different cone types generating graded potentials based on their specific wavelength sensitivity. The spatial distribution of activation would create a complex neural representation of the scene's color and luminance characteristics.",
